# Setup a new rclone remote

rclone config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> myPennbox
Storage> box
client_id>

Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine

For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.
Execute the following on your machine:
        rclone authorize "box"
Then paste the result below:
result >

# Leave the terminal open in HPC
# Install rclone on Windows desktop and open the command prompt
# Windows (key) + R (type in cmd)
# in cmd, go to directory where rclone is installed, then type

dir C:Temp\rclone

rclone.exe authorize "box"

# The above should open up a browser on your desktop and when prompted, use the username/password you have, 
# login and then click "Grant access".
# for a Penn Box use the SSO login window (to login via the penn website)
# This should print a very long json string in your Windows command prompt. Something that looks like:

{"access_token":"BlahBlahasdkfjalkwejrijBlahBlahBlah",,"token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"MoreBlahBlahBlah","expiry":"2019-12-06T07:01:07.7459684311-05:00"}

# Copy the entire string including curly braces and paste it within your terminal on the HPC

result> {"access_token":"BlahBlahasdkfjalkwejrijBlahBlahBlah",,"token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"MoreBlahBlahBlah","expiry":"2019-12-06T07:01:07.7459684311-05:00"}

# test if works (in HPC)

rclone ls myPennbox:mainfolder/subfolder

# copy data from the Box to HPC
rclone copy myPennbox:from/folder /project/lab/to/folder/

# copy data from HPC to the BOX
rclone copy /project/lab/from/folder/ myPennbox:to/folder
