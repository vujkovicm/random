# 1. On the HPC, launch an interactive job:
bsub -Is bash

# 2. Setup a new rclone remote :
rclone config
# make new rclone
n
name> myPennbox
Storage> box
client_id>
client_secret>
Edit advanced config? (y/n) 
y/n> n
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.
Execute the following on your machine:
        rclone authorize "box"
Then paste the result below:
result >

# IMPORTANT: leave the terminal open
# Now, on your Windows desktop (after you installed rclone on your desktop):
# Windows (key) + R (type in cmd)
# in command prompt go to directory where rcline is installed

rclone.exe authorize "box"

# The above should open up a browser on your desktop and when prompted, use the username/password you have, 
# login and then click "Grant access".
# for a Penn Box use the SSO login window (to login via the penn website)
# This should print a very long json string in your Windows command prompt. Something that looks like:

{"access_token":"BlahBlahasdkfjalkwejrijBlahBlahBlah",,"token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"MoreBlahBlahBlah","expiry":"2019-12-06T07:01:07.7459684311-05:00"}

# Copy the entire string including curly braces and paste it within your terminal on the HPC (step 2. above)
result> {"access_token":"BlahBlahasdkfjalkwejrijBlahBlahBlah",,"token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"MoreBlahBlahBlah","expiry":"2019-12-06T07:01:07.7459684311-05:00"}

# test if works
rclone ls myPennbox:MyPennBoxFolder/subfolder
